# the pytyhon for loop is used to iterate over asequence(list, tuple,string) or other iterable objects.
# iterating over asequence is called traversal
#syntax:   for var in sequence:
       # body of for loop will be executed
 # here var is be varibale that takes the value of the item inside
 # the sequence or each iteration.  
 # loop continuos until we reach the last item in the sequence,
 # the body of the for loop is separated from rest of the code using iteration.abs
